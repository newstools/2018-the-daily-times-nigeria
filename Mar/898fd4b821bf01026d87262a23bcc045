Justice Haruna Offor of a High Court in Nasarawa State has jailed a Kaduna State-based cleric, Pastor Bawa Madaki. The judge on Monday sentenced Madaki to 14 years’ imprisonment for trafficking two children aged five and seven years old – without an option of fine.  Following his arrest, the pastor was arraigned on a two count of deceitfully taking the two underage children from their parents in the Zanzo Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Madaki subsequently sent one child to Lagos State in “an illegal adoption arrangement and the other to Abuja as a domestic worker, thus depriving their parents of the children.”  The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP’s Head of Press and Public Relations, Josiah Emerole who disclosed that Madaki’s trial commenced on June 23, 2015.  Emerole said, “a cleric, Pastor Bawa Madaki, from Kaduna State, has been sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment for child trafficking. The accused was arraigned on two counts of fraudulently procuring two underage children from their parents. The trial commenced on June 23, 2015, and on Monday, March 26, 2018, the court found the accused guilty. The Director-General, NAPTIP, Julie Okah-Donli, has therefore cautioned the public against illegal adoption and engagement of underage children as domestic workers, who are often maltreated and abused by their employers. We warn detractors to desist from such acts as the long arm of the law will catch up with them if they fail to do so. This brings the convictions secured by NAPTIP to 342.”
