…As Reps begin move to override Buhari’s veto
Strong Indications emerged on Wednesday that the National Assembly is likely to pass into law the 2018 Appropriation Bill on April 24.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Yakubu Dogara, disclosed this when he read out a communication passed to him by Deputy Speaker of the House, Hon Yusuf Lasun, which stated that a harmonisation committee of the Senate and the House proposes to lay the report on the budget before both chambers on April 19, preparatory to its eventual passage on April 24. The Daily Times recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari had on November 7, 2017, laid the 2018 budget proposal before a joint session of the two chambers of the National Assembly. Dogara said: “We are proposing that we’re laying the budget finally on April 19, 2018, hopefully, we will be passing the budget on April 24, 2018. “This is a harmonised calendar with the Senate.” In another development, the House has begun the process to override President Buhari’s refusal to assent to bills sent for his assent by the National Assembly. The bills include the Electoral Amendment Bill and the Nigeria Peace Corps Bill. The move is in fulfilment of the pledge made by the Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Hon Abdulrazak Namdas, last Wednesday that the House would kick-start the override process soon. To this end, the two bills were read for the first time and are now due for second reading.
