Cool FM On Air Personality, Daddy Freeze, has called on Biggie and the organizers of the big brother naija reality game show to just award Miracle the grand price of N45million. Freeze said Biggie should stop wasting viewer’s time and give the 23-year-old pilot the money now. Recall that Freeze had revealed why he likes Miracle and has been campaigning for him to emerge as the winner. Here is what he wrote on Twitter below; “Dear #BBNaija, I have made up my mind. Please give #miracle the money.. anything after this point is a waste of our time. “@LewisHamilton won the F1 championship before the end of the season… This can be replicated in Big brother. “Make we see twitter do other things.”
