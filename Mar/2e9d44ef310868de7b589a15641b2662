A car wash attendant, Mohammed Chado, has been arrested by the police in Abuja for allegedly selling a Toyota Camry that was given to him for washing. The suspect, who worked at a car wash outlet in Apo, Abuja, allegedly made away with the car and sold it for N450,000, which he used to marry a wife. Chado, 29, was among 40 suspects paraded on Wednesday by the Commissioner of Police, Federal Capital Territory, Sadiq Bello. The police boss said, “Chado was arrested at Batafe village in Niger State where he hid after he sold a Toyota Camry that was given to him for washing. “He escaped with it, sold it for N450,000 and used the money to marry a wife. The stolen car has been recovered.” Chado, in an interview with PUNCH Metro, explained that out of the proceeds, he spent N300,000 on his wedding and expended the balance on feeding and other needs. The suspect said, “I sold the car for N450,000 and spent N300,000 on my wedding. I gave the money to my family to buy the needed wedding items. I spent the balance on feeding myself for one year.” The CP, Bello, said the command recovered from the other suspects 38 pump-action guns, 13 locally-made guns, one fabricated revolver, 25 fabricated modified pump-action guns, one double-barrelled gun and 22 cartridges. Other exhibits allegedly recovered were 11 vehicles, three cutlasses, eight fabricated pistols, nine television sets, one desktop monitor, three knives and one toy gun.
