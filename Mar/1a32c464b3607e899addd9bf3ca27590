Iceland on Monday announced it would stage a diplomatic boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia over the poisoning of a former double agent in Britain. “Icelandic officials will not go to the FIFA World Cup in Russia this summer,” a statement from the foreign ministry read. The EU member states have said it was highly likely Russia was responsible for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on March 4. They also ordered the recall of the bloc’s ambassador to Moscow. Iceland are in Group D alongside Nigeria, Argentina and Croatia.
