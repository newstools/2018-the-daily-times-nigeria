Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr has hailed the Super Eagles team, but insists they must keep working hard. Super Eagles beat highly rated Poland 1-0 away from home, to follow up their 4-2 win against Argentina. Rohr has warned against riding that wave, and has charged his men to keep working hard for the World Cup. “We’ve seen a lot of good things and some things we must work on before the World Cup in Russia,” Rohr was quoted as saying on BBC Sport. “Friendly matches provide a great opportunity to see everything about your team. “It is not really the same as a World Cup game. Our preparation is still a work in progress to be ready. “We know winning friendly matches could give us false hope but we want to keep working hard.”
