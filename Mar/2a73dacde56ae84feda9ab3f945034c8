Governor  Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, has reacted to allegations made against him by Senator Dino Melaye  who alleged that he was working with the Police to destroy his political career and also take his life.   Governor Yahaya Bello’s spokesperson,  Kingsley Fanwo, who released a statement on behalf of the Governor, advised Melaye to appear before the police to clear the criminal allegations against him.   The statement reads, “He should face the issue and leave the governor out of the issues surrounding his face off with the police. “The governor is a law-abiding citizen of Nigeria who would not involve himself in such criminality, home or abroad. No organisation has ever indicted the governor of such crime. He has respect for human life. “What has the governor got to do with that? Criminals were nabbed by the police and those criminals disclosed the persons behind the supply of arms to them.  “The simple thing to do here is for him to prove his case and leave the governor out of it. On our part as a government, we are pleased that our anti-crime efforts are yielding fruits. “Yahaya Bello is committed to ensuring the safety of all Kogi residents. That is his primary responsibility to the people of the state. “He has also commended the police for arresting criminals that were disturbing the peace of the state. Dino should rather face the law. The governor has nothing to do with his travails.”  Recall that Senator Dino Melaye, who reacted to reports of the arrest and parade of political thugs reportedly funded by him to unleash mayhem in Kogi State, had tweeted; Fabricated lies by Kogi State Govt and the police will fail. It’s utterly laughable and preposterous. It’s a sign of desperation. No amount of lies and blackmail will detract my attention from speaking the truth and defending it.
