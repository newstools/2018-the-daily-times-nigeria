Nollywood actor,  Femi Adebayo, in a one minute video he shared on Instagram warned his fans to stop having deals with internet fraudsters who use his name to perpetrate their fraudulent activities.   According to the actor, the video became necessary after he was hinted that many of his fans have fallen victim of the heinous crimes of these fraudsters  This is the first time I’m making a video on this issue. I don’t want people to fall victim again and lose their hard earned money online.  My official accounts are @femiadebayosalami on Facebook and instagram
