By Mutiat Alli Expected to perform at all the five locations includes indigenous rapper, Reminisce, Klint Da Drunk, FunnyBone, Osama and Buchi amongst others. On why he is taking the show outside Nigeria, Senator disclosed that Nigerians in the UK have been part of his success story. UK was my first international trip then under the umbrella of Crack ya ribs, the Julius Agwu brand in 2008. So Nigerians in the UK have always encouraged us with good positive vibes. They actually made request for the brand to come to the UK … So I gave it a thought and then reached out to my promoter friends in the UK Akinlolu Jekins of Slimz promotions and Efosa of Efoski entertainment who saw a need to put up the show. They are basically my partners in the show. Expected to be hosted by OAP Yaw, Senator further noted that aside from the fact that the Senator Most Distinguished brand is a unique one; this automatically indicates that going to the UK will further expose the brand and one of the unique expectations for the event is that a lot of political information will be exposed and the state of Nigeria will be reviewed. It’s classy humour.
