This represented 27.4 per cent and 81.3 per cent increase, above $13.29 billion and $9.34 billion in the preceding quarter and the corresponding period of 2017, respectively. “The increase in outflow relative to the preceding quarter was attributed to 32.2 per cent and 28.0 per cent increase in public sector payments and interventions in the foreign exchange market.” The report stated that a net outflow of $3.98 billion was recorded through the Bank, compared with $0.53 billion and $2.64 billion in the second quarter of 2018 and the corresponding period of 2017, respectively.

The report by CBN on oil sector receipts, disclosed that 14.2 per cent of the total was $3.69 billion compared with $3.15 billion and $3.17 billion in the preceding quarter and the corresponding period of 2017, respectively. “Non-oil inflow at $9.26 billion (35.6 per cent of the total) fell by 13.3 per cent below the level at the end of 2018 second quarter, but rose by 5.1 per cent over the level at the corresponding period of 2017. “Autonomous inflow, at $13.06 billion, fell by 30.6 per cent and 13.1 per cent below the levels at end of the preceding quarter of 2018 and the corresponding period of 2017, respectively. Inflow from autonomous sources accounted for 50.2 per cent of the total,” the report by CBN stated. The report added that, “Aggregate foreign exchange outflow from the economy, at $17.83 billion, rose by 25.6 per cent and 75.3 per cent, above the levels in the preceding quarter and the corresponding period of 2017, respectively.
