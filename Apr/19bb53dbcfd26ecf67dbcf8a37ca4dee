Vice-Chancellor of IMSU, Prof Adaobi Obasi says Big Brother Housemate, Nina will undergo Moral Rehabilitation upon return from BBnaija House. This is to purge her from any bad influences she might have picked up while featuring on the BBN show. Vice Chancellor of the institution reportedly told some Owerri based journalists that the measure is to forestall and foreclose any of the bad influences being transmitted on other students of the university where Nina is currently a student. She said:
“As we have a lot to do, you too have a lot to do. One of my students is now in Big Brother Naija. It is not the type of thing I am saying because I don’t see the need. I am talking of something positive; something that will help. We are praying, I told some people that this lady, whatever influence that she has, does not affect my other students here, my daughters here. “We give something that will yield something. I never know what that BBN, the morals it is teaching. Maybe I am the only one out there. I don’t know what it is teaching us. Is it to have sex in the public? So, this is my own opinion and I hold onto it. Can you imagine my student telling them that she will sort us out here. We are waiting for her to come and sort us out” “Didn’t you listen to her, that she would sort us out. When she finishes, let her come home and sort us out. If this girl comes back, I will watch her and make sure she has dropped those influences. I know I sent out some girls to America for leadership training. I allowed them upon return to teach others. This is the type of thing I want us to do. I will watch her and I will make sure she has dropped that influence” “We have never had hostels, but those hostels are ready now. I am taking the first year girls to the hostels because I can say they are intact. We can work from anywhere to do something. I have a passion for IMSU. If I leave it where I found it, generations will be against me”.
