Bang Dada Dang Cronner, Speed Darlington, whose song was played during the reality show’s Saturday night party headlined by DJ Lambo, called out Big Brother over not getting paid. According to Speed Darlington in the video he shared on Instagram, he makes no money as an independent artist, and therefore deserved to be paid by BBNaija.  “I hear BBNaija is using Bangdadadang and they gave me no money. They are using my music for free without penny in my pocket.  “All of you at my palace. I want to know if it’s true that someone is milking independent artist like me. Knowing very well I make no money from music, anytime you play my music on radio or TV I got to get paid” he said in the video.
