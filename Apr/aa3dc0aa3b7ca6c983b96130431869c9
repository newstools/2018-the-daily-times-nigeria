*Urges them to check cases of malpractices by private hospitals
Wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has tasked private medical institutions in Nigeria to make treatments affordable and accessible by reducing the high cost of their services in the country. Speaking while playing host to the officials of the Association of General and Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria at the Presidential Villa on Thursday in Abuja, Mrs. Buhari urged them to revisit the issues of charges to enable more people access their services. She said, “Private health care is expensive, your association needs to revisit the issue of charges to make treatments affordable so that more people can access your services and health outcomes can improve”. While urging the association to check cases of malpractice by private hospitals, which according to her are becoming more rampant, Mrs Buhari recommended a Public-Private Partnership, whereby private sector firms can invest in the health sector and reduce the burden on government. She added that she will soon convene a stakeholders meeting to create more awareness. “That is why I am convening a stakeholder event soon, to draw their attention to the possibilities and opportunities in the sector”, she added. Responding, President of the Association, Dr. Frank Odofen, commended wife of the President’s commitment to the health of women and children through the Future Assured Programme which led to her recent appointment as UNAIDS Ambassador. He said that with her passion and zeal to transform the nations health care, health care indices will soon improve in Nigeria. Also, President of World Organization of Family Doctors, Prof. Amanda Howe, who was on a two-day visit to Nigeria, observed that the pronouncements and programmes of Mrs. Buhari are worthy of emulation as the challenges in the health sector require strong commitment.
