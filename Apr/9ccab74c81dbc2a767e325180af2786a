While delivering a sermon to his congregation on Palm Sunday, Archbishop Nicholas Duncan-Williams advised ladies on how to treat their husband-to-be if they don’t want to remain single in life. He advice ladies to show respect by referring to such a man as ‘my lord’ cos men are moved by such. He further spoke on the consequence of always having fights with the man they are dating. He said such attitude or experience is an indication that a marriage between them will not work. He believes a good woman will bring out the best in a man while a woman not meant for a man will bring out the evil in a man. Read his words below. “Because if you marry him, it won’t work. You can quote all the scriptures in this world and say the two shall be one, it will not work.The need of every man is respect and adoration. You have to adore him: ‘mi wura’, ‘ntse’, my lord,” Archbishop Duncan-Williams said. “If you can’t call him ‘mi wura’, ‘ntse’, my lord, don’t marry him, it’s not going to work because men are wired in that way to feel respected, to be adored and to be praised. So, if you are the type, you don’t respect a man and you bring the devil out of him and not the king out of him, don’t marry him,” he warned again. “If you are dating a man, and you’re always fighting, anytime you talk, fight, anytime you talk, fight; it’s an indication it won’t work because you see, the woman that is your wife, will bring the king out of you, but the woman that is not your wife, will bring the devil out of you”.
