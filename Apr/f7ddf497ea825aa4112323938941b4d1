“Nina has emerged as the new head of house for week 12 after her fellow big brother naija housemates voted her to the position.”  It was not with controversy however, as there was an idea of letting Cee-C be the Head of House since she has not won the title since the show started.”  However Alex and Tobi did not buy the idea and made sure that she did not get the position.  Alex on her part revealed that she didn’t support the idea of Cee-C becoming the HoH, Alex said she doesn’t want Cee -C to be Head of House because she doesn’t want them to fight.”   Congratulations to Nina.
