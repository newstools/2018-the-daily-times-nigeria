  “Arsenal could be set for a major overhaul of their squad if former Barcelona manager, Luis Enrique replaces Arsene Wenger.”   The Gunners are hunting for their new manager ahead of the summer after Wenger announced decision to step aside.  Ex-Barcelona boss, Enrique is the favourite to take the hot seat at the Emirates.   It seems, however, he is ready to make some big demands for an agreement to be reached.   The Sun, UK, reports that Enrique has demanded as much as £200m to spend on transfers ahead of the 2018/19 season.   Enrique feels there needs to be changes with the goalkeeping department, the defence and the midfield.   The 47-year-old is prepared to rip through the Arsenal side,. who are poised to finish sixth in the Premier League.   The Sun added that Enrique has already identified potential additions, with 29-year-old Roma midfielder Raja Nainggolan a key target.   Enrique will not be afraid to sign older players, which goes against Wenger’s philosophy at the club.   Arsenal will have to offload a number of first-team stars to help fund a summer overhaul..   The former Barca boss would be working with former Barcelona director of football, Raul Sanllehi over any spending.”
