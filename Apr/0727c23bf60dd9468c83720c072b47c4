Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich is set to carry out a massive clear-out at the club. Nine first team players will compulsorily depart the club in the summer, alongside manager, Antonio Conte. A top source at Stamford Bridge told The Telegraph that The Blues who are currently without a technical director since the departure of Michael Emenalo would face the prospect of finding a viable replacement for the position. The newspaper reports that some senior members of the squad who Abramovich feels had under-performed this season will leave. However, Nigeria’s Victor Moses is safe from those mooted for possible departure. The players on Abramovich’s list include, Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Cesc Fabregas, Pedro, Gary Cahill, David Luiz, Michy Batshuayi, Kurt Zouma and even January signing, Olivier Giroud. Conte’s future at the club has been up in the air for much of the season and things had further sullied after the 3-1 defeat to Tottenham at the Stamford Bridge last weekend. Moses singed a two-year contract extension with Chelsea in March 2017 and the deal could keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2020-2021.
