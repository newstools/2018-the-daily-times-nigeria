British-Nigerian actor, John Boyega, made a stunning statement while on a show on CNBC Africa. And according to the talented actor, he is planning to shoot a low budget Nigerian movie with about $20-$25million (N9billion). Boyega spoke to Power Lunch West Africa host, Onyi Sunday during the promotion of his new movie “Pacific Rim.” “We’re developing a few Nigerian stories and choosing one which makes sense budget-wise. We’re probably looking at an indie budget of $20-$25 million dollars.” With the highest Nigerian movie having a budget less than $500,000, the “Star Wars” actor might be starting a revolution that will create a marriage between the Nigerian movie industry and the American movie industry. From the pictures he painted, John Boyega might have given the hint of working with one of Nollywood’s finest actresses, Genevieve Nnaji. “I’m very interested in original Nigerian stories. I grew up on Nollywood. The first Nollywood film I ever watched was Blood Sisters with Genevieve Nnaji,” the 26-year-old actor told Power Lunch West Africa host, Onyi Sunday during his interview at CNBC Africa. Boyega made his debut in the British sci-fi comedy “Attack the Block” after which his performance caught the attention of J.J Abrams, who decided to cast him as Finn in “Star Wars: The Force Awaken” at the young age of the then 19-year-old. The actor also revealed that his interest for telling Nigerian stories dates to many years ago and having reached a vantage position in the American movie industry, he feels it’s time to tell the Nigerian story in a professional way. He says: “It’s a chance for me to develop these stories, merge Hollywood with Nollywood, to bring the genuine and most important stories to light but captured in a very important and professional way. “I’ve been interested in Nigerian stories for a very very long time. It’s just that now I’ve worked to a point where I have the opportunity to do something.”
