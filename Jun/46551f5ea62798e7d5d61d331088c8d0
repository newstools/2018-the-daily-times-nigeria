Just like every other year, the annual celebration of Eid-el-fitr in Oluwanisola Estate, along Lekki-Ajah Expressway, Lagos was held in the billionaire mogul’s sprawling estate with Chief Rasaq Okoya and his vivacious wife, Alhaja Shade Okoya looking radiant like a new wedded couple. The prayer was coordinated by the chief Imam of the central mosque within the estate with little sermon from the Islamic cleric. From the prayer ground, family, guest, and well-wishers was ushered into the palatial mansion by the beautiful socialite and wife of the Aare of Lagos. The ambience was alluring as guests were treated to high champagne, red and white wines and other assorted soft drinks. Aside drinks, both local and intercontinental dishes were in abundant as the entire attendees felt at home. Aside the first wife, Alhaja Kudirat Okoya, the celebration witnessed notable personalities from political gladiators, business moguls and top entrepreneurs within and outside the country.
