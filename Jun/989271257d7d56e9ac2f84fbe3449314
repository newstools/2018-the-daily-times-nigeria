The program which would be hosted by Pastor, Ben Akabueze and facilitated by Funmito Agusto, is one of its kinds, featuring, Talk shows, relationship seminar, networking, fellowship and lots more. According to the rib-cracker, the program was inspired by the deep passion pastor, Ben Akubueze, has for the youth and singles. “He desires to see singles get married and settle down. But as we all know marriages crash faster than phone these days. Because many people don’t know that there are signs you will see and ignore. I have heard many say they are or were friends before they got married and yet have problems just few days after they walk down the aisle. This and networking is what this program is all about.  An event where we can talk, share experiences, ask questions, entertain ourselves. Laugh and get connected.” He continued: “Many Christian singles don’t really go out to clubs and social gathering any more. So, we don’t get to meet with the likes of people we would want to get married to. In fact, there are lots we need to know. In my own part,I have made a mistake in marriage before and I need to know more and ask more questions, so that I don’t make fall into another mistake. Our God is a God of second chance, so I’m hopeful” Art of Friendship also promised to thrill guests with entertainment like never seen before with lovely songs by Pillars, Lively stones,sound of many waters,while, Koffi, Igos, Bash,Mc Nomaris,Open Teeth,Head of State, Dr warri and other comedians will join Edo Charles to crack ribs.
