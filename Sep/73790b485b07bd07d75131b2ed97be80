Kourtney Kardashian had some scathing words for baby daddy,Scott Disick over the 35-year-old party-loving businessman introducing his girlfriend Sofia Richie to his children. Drama began on KUWTK when Kourtney rang her sister Kim, who was on a shoot with her mother Kris and grandmother MJ, in floods of tears on Facetime. Asked what was wrong she replied: ‘Nothing I can’t talk. P’s here … I’ll text you.’ Sure enough a text came through, which a shocked Kim read aloud to MJ: ‘Scott just text me that he introduced Mason to his girlfriend, and he didn’t even tell me first. We’ve been going to therapy to discuss it, and he said he was going to wait.’ But as Kourtney was texting her sister looking for support, Scott called up Kris and explained his side of things. Speaking to the momager on the phone, Scott said: ‘We all agreed to wait until after the New Year, so last night when we got home the kids were there so of course they met my girlfriend. ‘I told Kourtney, and she just told me, “You’re a fing joke. You’re disgusting, you do whatever you fing want”.’ Looking slightly taken aback by what she’d just heard, Kris said: ‘ I don’t understand why she can introduce her boyfriend to the kids, but you can’t introduce your girlfriend. I would just ask her why isn’t it mutual.’
