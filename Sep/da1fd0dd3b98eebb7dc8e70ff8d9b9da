The Nigerian pageant is a much-anticipated one and is one of the three largest pageants in Nigeria while the international one is also one of the three biggest pageants. Just like other pageants, Miss Earth is an annual event designed to empower women who are role models and also to maintain environmental friendliness. “Miss Earth pageants strongly believed in being socially responsible for our immediate environment, unlike other pageants that raise queens, Miss Earth pageant believed in raising ambassadors that will pioneer sustainable development in their environments. “Every year the winners of the beauty pageants (4 in number) will represent the 4 main elements of the world each which includes Water, Air, Fire and Earth with the aim of promoting environmental awareness,” says Fiberesima. The 4 winners of Miss Earth Nigeria pageant will re-contest to bring out the overall winner who will be seen as the environmental Earth warrior and ambassador and will represent the country at international level. The beauty contest will feature a series of awards such as Best in a creative outfit, Miss Photogenic, Miss Talent and Miss Friendship.
