…To be charged to court soon
…Women Affairs ministry takes custody of victim
A 65-year-old man, Matthew Omokhafe, is currently cooling his heels in police detention in Benin City, the Edo State capital, for allegedly defiling and impregnating a 13-year-old primary four pupil in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of the state. The Acting Chairman, Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe, who disclosed this in a chat with journalists in Benin City, on Friday, said that “we took a course of action by visiting and ensuring that the case was transferred from the Akoko-Edo Area Division of the Nigeria Police Division to the State Criminal Investigation Department in the state capital.” She attributed the arrest and subsequent handover of the victim’s custody to the State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development to “efforts by Child Protection Network (CPN) as well as the SUBEB.’’ The acting chairman assured that the accused would be charged to court to ensure that justice is done. Edo SUBEB has been at the forefront of the fight against child abuse and molestation which is recording success in the arrest and prosecution of perpetrators in the state. Besides, the board has been working in tandem with the state Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development with a view to bringing succour to the affected children, and ensuring their safety.
