By: Isaac Oguntoye Their marriage was consummated on October 31, 2013 and separated December 7, 2014 while the divorce proceedings commenced in 2016. Justice O.S. Olusanya in his ruling dissolved the marriage on the basis that it has irretrievably broken down, and additionally on the basis of desertion by the respondent. As she had deserted the matrimonial home with no intention to return as indicated by evidence during trial. The highly devastated singer an OAP, Uduak who was approached shortly after the pronouncement for a reaction said he had no comment but that he only wanted to be a good dad to his adorable son. As informed, the respondent, Blessing had denied the father access to the child for two years while the case lasted. All effort to reach his wife was aborted as there was no contact of her made available to this office. Meanwhile, the judge awarded custody to the respondent, the only product of their liaison, a  4-year old male child, with the petitioner getting unrestricted access and visitation rights.
People who used to know the couple together said that their separation has deeply wreaked havoc on Tito’s sense of self esteem. “Marriage break up is like an ultimate assault, an incalculable insult to who you are or thought you were. It can make you doubt things that earlier you took for granted. And it can also deal a huge blow to your ability, or willingness, to trust others (and maybe yourself as well).” Another family member told us on the ground of anonymity that their break up represents a loss of innocence: a sadder-but-wiser, unasked-for introduction into a world more perplexing and painful than they might ever have imagined.
