By: Mutiat Alli Below are 6 amazing sweater types that you can wear this rainy season: Oversized sweaters.  The bigger the better you know. Who ever said size does not matter, clearly never wore or seen a sophisticated boho-chic oversized sweater paired with anything, especially skinny pants, jeans, OR miniskirts. Metallic sweaters  Are quite the deal this season, which is perfect because they can go from office hours to late night dinners or even cocktails? They look so fabulous, yet have a certain effortlessness to them, sort of like saying ‘I just threw this on and here I am.’ Silver & gold styles are the best Turtleneck sweaters  The 70s pals! Or just a great solution to hide from the cold. From loose to skin tight, to roll or messy turtlenecks they’re all in, whether on oversized or tight sweaters, they do the style trick. To get that gorgeous look everyone is buzzing about these days, tuck your hair in Chunky sweaters  These are the best fashion invention ever. For freezing temperatures. For fat days. And being in right now makes them okay not just for weekends or mountain trips, but for everyday no matter the occasion. A little half tuck always gives a bit of chicness to the look and waist definition. Pastels or powdered sweaters  Crazy prints and funky patters step aside, it’s time for monochromatic style, for muted colours, for pastels and dainty hues to rule this autumn. Whites, blues, pinks, and tons of greys are invading the streets and the shops. I call it the Sanguine kind of sweater. Besides, they carry a bit more class and sophistication to them. One colour sweaters  Okay, so patterns and prints may not be so hot this fall that does not mean we can’t wear them though. If you are looking for simplicity but beautiful one colour sweater is your pick .
