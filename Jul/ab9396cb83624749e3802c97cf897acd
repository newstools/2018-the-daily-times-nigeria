By: Isaac Oguntoye The visits were indeed a morale booster for the owners and workers of these two business concerns. First to be visited was the fast-excelling in patronage eatery, popularly known as OYO AMALA, owned by upwardly mobile and industrious businessman, Henry Alade, a.k.a Old School. The proprietor of Oyo Amala joint was so elated at the arrival of K-1 and his crew at his joint, that he was grinning from ear to ear to ensure a good reception of his August visitors. As a mark of appreciation to the August visitors, Henry Alade treated K-1 and his crew to very sumptuous dishes, especially their most known and advertised delicacy, AMALA and assorted soups garnished with many condiments, which K-1 and his crew munched to their delight and satisfaction. After the munching, K-1 took to the stand to offer incisive and encouraging prayers and admonition for Henry Alade and his team in the culinary business, calling on Almighty God to bless the business mightily by way of continued and soaring patronage of the business and Godâ€™s protection of the business environment, to which everyone in attendance shouted AMEN in unison. The next port of call of K-1 and his team within the same Omole Estate was the exquisite and fully-stocked supermarket aptly dubbed OLD ENGLISH, owned by versatile and veteran society journalist, At Old English, K-1 and his crew randomly went round the neatly arranged items on display at the fast-expanding mall-like supermarket that has virtually everything in stock to readily qualify as a one-stop outlet for customers of any demand. K-1 was so impressed at the innovation.
