By: Isaac Oguntoye Abike Dabiri is one of those women that played a vital role during the campaign especially in Lagos but today, she’s nowhere to be found. The former member of the Nigeria Federal House of Representatives was rewarded handsomely with Senior Special Assistant on Foreign Affairs and the Diaspora after her party won the federal seat. Abike is not new when it comes to handling the affairs of the diaspora. During her tenure as a member of the House of Representatives, she was the chairperson on Diaspora Affairs during former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. Leaving her footprints behind wherever she works, Abike has won the heart of many Nigerians from her days as a Newsline Anchor till and also as former member of the House of Representatives but fail to replicate her same trait as a crusader for change with her new appointment. The beautiful and stylish politician is missing both at the forefront of her primary assignment and also on social circle.
