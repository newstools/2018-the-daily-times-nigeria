By: Isaac Oguntoye His astronomic rise in the Fuji music genre, is not in anyway related to him riding on the popularity of his late father, who is the creator of the Fuji genre of music, Late Alhaji Ayinde Barrister; Barryshokey is indeed a dexterous born artiste blessed with the Midas touch of Gold. While he was in Nigeria, He attended Victory Nursery & Primary Ojota, Lagos, and proceeded to A-Z International School, Ajao Estate. Thereafter, he procedded to Gideon International school before travelling to reside in United State of America. At a point where many of his peers were busy spending the stupendous wealth of their father, Barryshokey found solace in music. He choose to tread on the path his father followed. He carved a niche for himself, notching over 8 album to his credit which sold platinum on it release date. However, He was one of the first Fuji artiste who infused Fuji music into Hip Hop Music in year 2002, under Kenny Music. He was rewarded for his sheer dint of hard work with a nomination at the prestigious KORA AWARD held in South Africa. Even in the face of sheer criticism, Barry remained dogged and stayed through to his dreams which finally payed off for him with a wide fan base both in Nigeria and other European countries. It was gathered from a close source that; ”Barryshokey is returning back to Nigeria with more fire power. Nobody does his style of Fuji music. The lacuna he left while he was away is yet to be filled up, he is returning to fill it up. Trust me, this time around, he is ready to marvel all his fans in Nigeria with more hit songs. Barry on his return, will be doing some gigs and other special appearance. He has been booked for events till December 2018. He will drop a smashing yet-to-be titled track this September for his teeming fans. Trust me you have never head this combination and rhythm before.”
