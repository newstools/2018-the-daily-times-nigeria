By: Mutiat Alli The movie, Lara and the Beat, is about the coming of age of the young and beautiful Giwa sisters caught in the centre of a financial scandal with their late parents’ Media Empire. The sisters are forced out of their privileged bubble, and must learn to build their own future – through music and enterprise – to salvage their family’s past. According to Biola Alabi, “Lara and the Beat is a reinforcement of our promise and goal to continue to tell authentic African stories to local and global audiences. We have worked with the best talents in the industry and engaged key partnerships and collaborations that have helped to deliver this outstanding movie. Themes explored in the movie, as seen in the trailer, include financial literacy, family values, sisterhood, friendship, music, fashion, culture and love .Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), a major partner of the movie, believes that this handshake with the film industry is the best way to spread the vital message of civic duty and civic responsibilities.
