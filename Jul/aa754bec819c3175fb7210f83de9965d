By: Isaac Oguntoye And beyond her care for the good people of Ogun State, Mrs. Amosun is a known campaigner and advocate of women’s upliftment. The prime mover of Uplift Development Foundation has been helping the vulnerable within and outside the state even before her husband was elected the governor of the Golden Gate state. She is an advocate for a better and healthy living among women living within the rocky state.  Uplift Development Foundation was birth in October 2012, and ever since then it has become a bait to reach out to women with breast and cervical cancer. She organizes a sensitization programme in four different locations in Ogun state at no cost. She also extended her helping hands to the female students from different tertiary institutions across the state; where they all benefited immensely on the measures to detect and prevent the deadly disease. No doubt the beautiful sexagenarian first lady has been playing a vital role in eliminating poverty among women in Nigeria.
