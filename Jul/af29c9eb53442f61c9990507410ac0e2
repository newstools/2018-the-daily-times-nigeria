We are having two celebrations today our 25th anniversary and our sports day and to think that it was held during working hour and mid week yet important personalities still grace it. My sincere appreciation goes to HRM Oba Olusegun Oludolapo Ogunye who also stands as our royal father of the day.

Other personalities that grace the event includes; Mr. Joshua Oderinde who is a Director of Finance Food Institute of Research Oshodi,(FIRRO), Princess (Mrs.) Victoria Adenike Akinyele, HRM , Oba Olusegun Oludolapo Ogunye (Royal Father of The Day), Mrs. Sholola Grace the proprietress of Richfield day school, Ajao Estate, Mrs. Saseyi Lola  among others
