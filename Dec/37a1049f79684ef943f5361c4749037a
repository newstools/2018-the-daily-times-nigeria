…Ex-VP to lead the opposition coalition under PDP flag
Ahead of 2019 Presidential election, 41 political parties have adopted the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, as consensus candidate. This is a ratification of a Memorandum of Understanding signed by over 45 political parties under the umbrella of the Coalition of United Political parties (CUPP), during its historic inauguration at the Shehu Musa Yar’ Adua Centre, Abuja, early in the year. The spokesperson of CUPP, IIkenga Imo Ugochinyere said by this declaration, all Presidential candidates of the parties in the alliance have relinquished their mandate for Atiku’s sole candidature on the platform of the PDP. He said “the former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential candidate of PDP is now the consensus candidate of the opposition. “Over 41 political parties in attendance, endorsed the decision which enjoyed majority support. “The coalition arrived at Atiku’s choice after he towered high on the criteria used by the opposition in arriving at the decision which includes national acceptability, financial capacity, spread of his political party, leadership capacity, international acceptability, experience, capacity to rebuild the economy, secure the country and unite all Nigerians among other factors. Ugochinyere disclosed that the coalition parties will be formally meeting with Atiku before Friday for formal commencement of the coalition campaign.
