Prince Secondus noted that APC leaders have exhausted their lies and have come to the end of the road since the people cannot be fooled all of the time. “Atiku Abubakar is a man set out by providence to rescue this country from the APC mess and we must give him our votes. “He is the man destined to make Nigeria work again and he would end hunger and unite Nigerians once again. The National Chairman warned the Police and other security operatives who might want to connive with INEC and APC to thwart the will of the people, that they would be stoutly resisted since the voters are determined to act as electoral soldiers to guard and protect their votes.

On his part the Presidential candidate, Atiku assured the people that with their mandate he would drastically address the myriads of the problems facing the country. The highpoint of the rally which attracted top PDP leaders from the North Central zone was the handing over of victory flags to the Presidential candidate and PDP gubernatorial flag bearers in five states of Benue, Niger, Nasarawa, Plateau and Kwara excluding Kogi whose governorship election is due later in 2019 Ahead of the South West rally to be held in Ibadan today, the party has said it is set to dislodge the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections.
